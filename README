index
=========

Sel: 260430732:

Appears to be meta-data/index.

loadmetascript refers to a file later in the index so it is probably not part of the index.

Actual index probably starts 52 bytes into index.sar (actually 51, first byte is length of first string path)

Byte (2 bytes? first one always zero, but that would be big endian) just before string is length of string, woo. None > 127 so can't determine if it is signed or unsigned, presume unsigned.

Format Spec
===========
1 byte - string_length
string_length+1 bytes - null terminated string
4 bytes - offset (definitely offset)
2 sets of identical (check this) 4 bytes - file size

Header
=========
16 bytes

Probably looking for an offset for the index data, 260430783

Maybe the table size? That is 21132 or 0x528c

Maybe the number of table entries? 299 entries 0x12b

Header Format
=============
6 bytes - SARCFV
2 bytes - 0x01 0x01 (maybe a version number?)
4 bytes - number of table entries
4 bytes - offset of above index
